# Performance-Analysis-of-Model-Optimization-Techniques  
• Utilized a pre-trained Inception V3 model with image data set.  
• Conducted hyper-parameter tuning, experimenting with model optimizers like Adam and Glorot.    
• Explored regularization and weight initialization techniques to identify the optimal combination.  
• Achieved a classification accuracy of 83.99% using the Adam optimizer with random normal and L1 regularization.
